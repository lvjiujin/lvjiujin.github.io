### GloVe: Global Vectors for Word Representation



## 一、总览



Glove, short for "Global Vectors for Word Representation", 顾名思义，从全局角度构建word2vec. 

本质做法：在MF（矩阵分解） + word2vec 的结合, 充分利用各自的优点，同时克服对应的缺点。

MF（PLSA, SVD等)： 优点：充分利用全局的统计信息，构建词贡献矩阵。

​									 缺点：在词类比任务上表现差。

Word2vec(skip-gram, cbow): 优点：利用局部的上下文窗口信息训练的词向量在词类比任务上表现不错。

​													缺点：没有充分利用全局的统计信息。（学习不到全局的信息）



So far, we have looked at two main classes of methods to find word embeddings. 

The first set are count-based and rely on matrix factorization (e.g. LSA, HAL). While these methods effectively leverage global statistical information, they are primarily used to capture word similarities and do poorly on tasks such as word analogy, indicating a sub-optimal vector space structure. 

The other set of methods are shallow window-based (e.g. the skip-gram and the CBOW models), which learn word embeddings by making predictions in local context windows. These models demonstrate the capacity to capture complex linguistic patterns beyond word similarity, but fail to make use of the global co-occurrence statistics.

## 三、论文详细剖析

## Abstract

Recent methods for learning vector space representations of words have succeeded in capturing fine grained semantic and syntactic regularities (细粒度的语法和语义规则) using vector arithmetic,but the origin of these regularities has remained opaque.(但是这些规则的源头仍然不清楚，不透明)

We analyze and make explicit the model properties needed for such regularities to emerge in word vectors.

我们分析并明确了在词向量中出现这些规则所需的模型属性。

<table><tr><td bgcolor=violet>The result is a new global log bilinear regression model that combines the advantages of the two major model families in the literature: global matrix factorization and local context window methods. Our model efficiently leverages statistical information by training only on the nonzero elements in a word-word cooccurrence matrix, rather than on the entire sparse matrix or on individual context windows in a large corpus.</td></tr></table>
结果就是一种新的全局对数双线性回归模型结合了两种重要的模型家族：全局矩阵分解和局部上下文窗口方法。

## Introduction

Most word vector methods rely on the distance or angle between pairs of word vectors as the primary
method for evaluating the intrinsic quality of such a set of word representations.

过去的评价词向量质量的方法： 大多数词向量方法依赖词向量对之间的角度或者距离作为主要评价一组词表示的内在质量的方法。

Recently, Mikolov et al. (2013c) introduced a new evaluation scheme based on word analogies (单词类比) that probes the finer structure of the word vector space by examining not the scalar distance between word vectors, but rather their various dimensions of difference. 

新的方法：利用词向量空间的更精细的结构，不再是词向量之间的数量距离，而是多个维度上的不同。

For example, the analogy “king is to queen as man is to woman” should be encoded in the vector space by the vector equation king − queen = man − woman. 

这个经典句子的英文表达

This evaluation scheme favors models that produce dimensions of meaning, thereby capturing the multi-clustering idea of distributed representations (Bengio, 2009). 

这种评估方案有利于产生意义维度的模型，从而捕获分布式表示的多聚类思想。

<table><tr><td bgcolor=violet>分布式表示本质上就是一种多聚类思想</td></tr></table>
<table><tr><td bgcolor=violet>The two main model families for learning word vectors are: 1) global matrix factorization methods, such as latent semantic analysis (LSA) (Deerwesteret al., 1990) and    2) local context window methods, such as the skip-gram model of Mikolov et al. (2013c). </td></tr></table>
Currently, both families suffer significant drawbacks. While methods like LSA efficiently leverage statistical information, they do relatively poorly on the word analogy task, indicating a sub-optimal vector space structure.  

MF(LAS, SVD) 矩阵分解高效利用统计信息，但是相对的在词类比任务上表现很差。

Methods like skip-gram may do better on the analogy task, but they poorly utilize the statistics of the corpus since they train on separate local context windows instead of on global co-occurrence counts. 

SG在词类比任务上表现好，但是不能很好的利用语料库的统计信息，因为他们在训练时只是运用孤立的局部上下文窗口，而不是全局的共现矩阵。

In this work, we analyze the model properties necessary to produce linear directions of meaning and argue that global log-bilinear regression models are appropriate for doing so. 

<table><tr><td bgcolor=violet>We propose a specific weighted least squares model that trains on global word-word co-occurrence counts and thus makes efficient use of statistics. </td></tr></table>
我们提出了一种特定权重最小二乘法的模型，用来训练全局的词与词之间的共现矩阵计数值。

The model produces a word vector space with meaningful substructure, as evidenced by its state-of-the-art performance of 75% accuracy on the word analogy dataset.

### Glove Model

#### 1. Co-occurrence Matrix

Let $X$ denote the word-word co-occurrence matrix, where $X_{ij}$ indicates the number of times word $j$ occur in the context of word $i$. 

Let $$X_i = \sum{_k}X_{ik}$$ be the number of times any word k appears in the context of word i. 

Finally, let $ P_{ij} = P({w_j}|{w_i}) = \frac{X_{ij}}{X_i} $​  be the probability of j appearing in the context of word i.



$$\begin{array}{l|cccc}
\text { Probability and Ratio } & k=\text {solid} & k=\text {gas } & k=\text {water } & k=\text {fashion } \\
\hline P(k \mid \text {ice}) & 1.9 \times 10^{-4} & 6.6 \times 10^{-5} & 3.0 \times 10^{-3} & 1.7 \times 10^{-5} \\
P(k \mid \text {steam}) & 2.2 \times 10^{-5} & 7.8 \times 10^{-4} & 2.2 \times 10^{-3} & 1.8 \times 10^{-5} \\
P(k \mid \text {ice}) / P(k \mid \text {steam}) & 8.9 & 8.5 \times 10^{-2} & 1.36 & 0.96
\end{array}$$



The above table suggests that the appropriate starting point for word vector learning should be with ratios of co-occurrence probabilities rather than the probabilities themselves. 

Noting that the ratio $P_{ik}/P_{jk} $depends on three words $i$, $j$, and  $k$ the most general model takes the form

$$F\left(w_{i}, w_{j}, \tilde{w}_{k}\right)=\frac{P_{i k}}{P_{j k}}$$     $(1)$

where $$w \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$$ are word vectors and  $$\tilde{w} \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$$ are separate context word vectors.

In this equation, the right-hand side is extracted from the corpus, and $F$ may depend on some as-of-yet unspecified parameters.

The number of possibilities for $F$ is vast, but by enforcing a few desiderata we can select a unique choice.

First, we would like $F$ to encode the information present the ratio $P_{ik}/P_{jk} $ in the word vector space. Since vector spaces are inherently linear structures, the most natural way to do this is with vector differences. 

因为向量空间内在的线性结构，很自然的方式就是向量做差，于是由公式1转化为公式2

With this aim, we can restrict our consideration to those functions $F$ that depend only on the difference of the two target words, modifying Eqn. (1)  to

$$F\left(w_{i}-w_{j}, \tilde{w}_{k}\right)=\frac{P_{i k}}{P_{j k}}$$    $(2)$

Next, we note that the arguments of $F$ in Eqn. (2) are vectors while the right-hand side is a scalar. While $F$ could be taken to be a complicated function parameterized by, e.g., a neural network, doing so would obfuscate the linear structure we are trying to capture. 

 $$P_{ij} = P({w_j}|{w_i}) = \frac{X_{ij}}{X_i}  $$ be the probability of j appearing in the context of word i.

由于公式(2)右边的概率值是一个标量，为了简化F，防止线性结构复杂化，将公式(2)​转化为公式(3), F内部参数做点积，变为标量。

To avoid this issue, we can first take the dot product of the arguments,

$$F\left(\left(w_{i}-w_{j}\right)^{T} \tilde{w}_{k}\right)=\frac{P_{i k}}{P_{j k}}$$  $(3)$

which prevents $F$ from mixing the vector dimensions in undesirable ways.



Next, note that for word-word co-occurrence matrices, the distinction between a word and a context word is arbitrary and that we are free to exchange the two roles. To do so consistently, we must not only exchange $$\mathcal{W} \leftrightarrow \widetilde{W}$$  but also $$X \leftrightarrow X^{T}$$. 

对于共现矩阵，单词和上下文单词之间的区别是任意的，我们可以自由地交换这两个角色. 

Our final model should be invariant under this relabeling, but Eqn. (3) is not. 

However, the symmetry can be restored in two steps. 

F 函数是同态的。(同态属于群论[group theory]的内容，具体可以参考 abstract algebra)

First, we require that F be a homomorphism between the groups $(\mathbb{R},+)$ and $$\left(\mathbb{R}_{>0}, \times\right)$$  i.e.

$$F\left(\left(w_{i}-w_{j}\right)^{T} \tilde{w}_{k}\right)=\frac{F\left(w_{i}^{T} \tilde{w}_{k}\right)}{F\left(w_{j}^{T} \tilde{w}_{k}\right)}$$  $(4)$

which, by Eqn. (3), is solved by,

$$F\left(w_{i}^{T} \tilde{w}_{k}\right)=P_{i k}=\frac{X_{i k}}{X_{i}}$$  $$(5)$$

The solution to Eqn. (4) is $F$ = exp, or,

$$w_{i}^{T} \tilde{w}_{k}=\log \left(P_{i k}\right)=\log \left(X_{i k}\right)-\log \left(X_{i}\right)$$   $(6)$

为了呈现交换对称性, 同时由于公式(6)中 等式右边的$\log \left(X_{i}\right)$ 独立于k, 所以将它吸收进偏执(抽象成) $b_i$ ,同时增加  $\tilde{b}_{k}$

Next, we note that Eqn. (6) would exhibit the exchange symmetry if not for the $$\log \left(X_{i}\right)$$ on the right-hand side. However, this term is independent of $k$ so it can be absorbed into a bias $b_i$ for  $ w_i$ . Finally, adding an additional bias $$\tilde{b}_{k}$$ for $$\tilde{w}_{k}$$ restores the symmetry,

$$w_{i}^{T} \tilde{w}_{k}+b_{i}+\tilde{b}_{k}=\log \left(X_{i k}\right)$$  $(7)$

Eqn. (7) is a drastic simplification over Eqn. (1), but it is actually ill-defined since the logarithm diverges
whenever its argument is zero. One resolution to this issue is to include an additive shift in the logarithm, $\log \left(X_{i k}\right) \rightarrow \log \left(1+X_{i k}\right)$, which maintains the sparsity of X while avoiding the divergences.

共现矩阵的分解方法有一个重要的缺陷就是它对所有共现的情况都一视同仁，即使是那些很少发生或从不发生的情况。（这也是代价巨大的原因所在，不考虑稀疏性）

The idea of factorizing the log of the co-occurrence matrix is closely related to LSA and we will use the resulting model as a baseline in our experiments.

A main drawback to this model is that it weighs all co-occurrences equally, even those that happen rarely or never.

#### 2. Least squares Objective



We propose a new weighted least squares regression model that addresses these problems.
Casting Eqn. (7) as a least squares problem and introducing a weighting function f (Xi j ) into the cost function gives us the model

$$J=\sum_{i, j=1}^{V} f\left(X_{i j}\right)\left(w_{i}^{T} \tilde{w}_{j}+b_{i}+\tilde{b}_{j}-\log X_{i j}\right)^{2}$$  $(8)$

where V is the size of the vocabulary. The weighting function should obey the following properties:
1. $f (0) = 0 $. If $f$ is viewed as a continuous function, it should vanish as $x \rightarrow 0$ fast enough that the $\lim _{x \rightarrow 0} f(x) \log ^{2} x$ is finite.
2. $f (x) $ should be non-decreasing so that rareco-occurrences are not overweighted.
3. $f (x)$ should be relatively small for large values of $x$, so that frequent co-occurrences are not overweighted.

Of course a large number of functions satisfy these properties, but one class of functions that we found
to work well can be parameterized as,

$$f(x)=\left\{\begin{array}{cc}
\left(x / x_{\max }\right)^{\alpha} & \text { if } x<x_{\max } \\
1 & \text { otherwise }
\end{array}\right.$$   $(9)$

Recall that for the skip-gram model, we use softmax to compute the
probability of word j appears in the context of word i:

$$ Q_{i j}=\frac{\exp \left(\vec{u}_{j}^{T} \vec{v}_{i}\right)}{\sum_{w=1}^{W} \exp \left(\vec{u}_{w}^{T} \vec{v}_{i}\right)} $$





$$\begin{equation}F\left(w_{i}, w_{j}, \tilde{w}_{k}\right)=\frac{P_{i k}}{P_{j k}}\end{equation}$$
